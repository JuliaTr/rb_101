### A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# Informal pseudo-code
=begin
Given an array of strings.

Within the method iterate through the array of strings one by one:
  - save the first value as the starting value;
  - for each iteration, add the next value to the current value;
  - reassign the saved value as the current value.

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.
=end
